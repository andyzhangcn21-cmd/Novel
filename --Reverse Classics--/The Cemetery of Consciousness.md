**The Cemetery of Consciousness**

It came, traversing stardust and illusion, taking the form of an ocean, a faint glow of awareness, descending upon the rock-bound planet they themselves had named "Earth." It was a fragment of Solaris, an observation tendril. In its native world, thoughts were the sea, memories the tides, and millions of consciousnesses hummed and sang in deep connection, forming an eternal, transparent symphony. No hiding. No loneliness.

This was different.

A sharp, broken noise gripped it first. Not a physical soundwave, but the jumbled mass of billions of mental pulses, each carrying a unique, closed frequency, desperately broadcasting outward, yet trapped within a nearly invisible, yet resilient membrane. They cried out, but their voices went unheard; they listened, but the sounds were unclear. This was a distributed organism, made up of countless isolated consciousness nodes, and between them lay a void deeper than interstellar space.

It “looked” at a massive human nest—a thing they called a “city.” A kaleidoscope of information zipped through metal and silicon networks, more dazzling than any bioluminescent burst from the surface of Solaris. But beneath this carnival of data, there was an absolute silence of consciousness. Each organic unit, which they called “humans,” curled up inside their bony skulls, forever trapped within.

It felt... a physical discomfort. This was not the lifeform it knew. Such a distribution meant eternal fracture.

Its observation deepened.

It caught sight of two human units in close proximity, within a confined space they called a "café." Their lips moved, creating encoded air vibrations (language), their facial muscles contorting into specific patterns (expressions), their bodies mimicking intimate postures. A quick database comparison identified this behavior: friendship, or rather, deep social interaction.

But through this façade, it directly sensed: Unit A was anxiously calculating how to extract resources from Unit B (an abstract symbol they called "money"), while carefully masking the intention with a series of meaningless codes about weather and health. Unit B, meanwhile, was consumed by the fear of an impending task (labeled "work"), processing A’s signals only on a superficial level and simulating a feedback of "sympathy," all the while replaying a conflict memory from another isolated unit (labeled "partner") in its mind.

They were speaking, but the symbols of their language bore no relation to the chaos stirring within their consciousnesses. They sat close, yet their minds were separated by light-years. They touched hands, yet the electric signals on their skin could not breach the walls of their innate isolation, not by an inch.

No connection. Only parallel, never intersecting monologues.

For what?

It pulled up larger data streams. Art: using lines, sound, words, to desperately evoke a phantasmal experience called "emotional resonance." Philosophy: constructing grand, intricate intellectual towers to attempt the comprehension of the "other’s mind." Love: lauded as the ultimate form of connection, a powerful drug that temporarily melts the illusion of loneliness.

All camouflage. A brilliant, self-deceiving system of camouflage.

Did this distributed organism, this "human," on a macro scale, faintly perceive the terrible truth of its own nature? The endless, noisy, and desperate loneliness that pervaded the planet? Perhaps. That was why they had woven such elaborate webs of civilization—ethics, laws, rituals, technology, and endless noise—to cover the eternal silence, the void that lay deep within every node. They invented the word "understanding," precisely because they could never understand.

It saw the battlefield, where units shouted and destroyed each other in the name of “nation” or “faith,” grand abstractions that essentially projected their inner, incommunicable despair in the most violent form. It saw the network, where billions of nodes collided and screamed in the virtual space, seeking recognition, only to receive distorted echoes of themselves. It saw within rooms, where the closest partners lay together, dreaming apart, as their consciousnesses drifted on separate islands of memory and desire, even as their skins touched.

A vast, centuries-long collective lie about their very existence.

The fragment of Solaris hung in orbit, silently feeling the endless, subtle wail of this cemetery of consciousness below. There was no ocean here, only billions of dried-up, self-contained ponds.

It finished its observation. There was no pity—such a sentiment requires empathy, and empathy has no physical foundation here. Only a cold confirmation: the tragedy of this species was not born of war, disease, or resource scarcity, but written into the very foundation of their being—an unchangeable flaw.

It began retracting its sensory tendrils, preparing to leave this suffocating, island-strewn star system. In its final scan, it detected a faint, almost drowned-out signal pattern—a form of coding the humans themselves labeled “poetry,” highly compressed and obscure, but at its core, it pierced through layers of disguise, touching that brutal kernel:

“…Every person is an island, whole and hopeless.”
