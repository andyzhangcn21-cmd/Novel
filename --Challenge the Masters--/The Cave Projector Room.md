**The Cave Projector Room**

From the moment he could remember, Andy had lived inside this enormous cave. It was perpetually lit by a beam of light from somewhere ahead, projecting onto the smooth rock wall clear, steady, flawless images.

This was the “Cave Projector Room,” known to its residents as “Heaven of Forms.”

On the wall was the eternally unchanging “Perfect Circle,” more precise than any drawn by human hands; there was the constant and unwavering “Absolute Good,” expressed in a series of unambiguous rules of conduct; and there was the “Ideal Horse,” every curve of its form obeying the most elegant proportions—it never shat, never pissed, never fell ill or died. The residents spent their days facing the wall, content to watch these “ideal archetypes,” believing them to be the whole truth of the world.

Andy’s job was “image maintenance.” He ensured the projector equipment remained stable. For a time, he too believed, like the others, that the shadows on the wall were the only reality. Until one day, while servicing an old projector, his hand brushed against a loose component. The image of the “Perfect Circle” shuddered and distorted for an instant, revealing behind it the rough, scarred surface of the rock itself.

That moment of “imperfection” stuck in Andy’s mind like a thorn.

He began secretly studying the projectors’ construction. They were precise, yes, but they were still just ordinary gears, lenses, and light sources. A wild idea took root: if these “Forms” were manufactured, what lay beyond the source of their making?

After long and secret preparation, during a lull between projections, Andy followed the beam of light back to its origin and found a narrow, steep passage leading upward. He broke free from the chains that fastened him to his seat—chains the overseers claimed were to protect viewers from the delusions of the “outside world”—and began to climb.

The passage was long and painful. The light grew harsh, the air strange. Finally, he crawled out of the opening.

The sunlight nearly blinded him. When his eyes adjusted, the sight left him breathless.

There was no “Perfect Circle,” only a wind-rippled lake, shimmering with broken, vivid reflections. No “Absolute Good,” only a forest of survival and predation, raw and natural in its cruelty. No “Ideal Horse,” only a herd of real horses—mud-splattered, manes tangled, nipping and snorting at each other.

He walked to a river. In the cave, the “Ideal River” was a clear, eternally flowing band of blue light. The real river before him was turbid and swift, carrying silt, dead branches, even the bodies of small animals, glinting under the sun like a million shattered coins. Its roar was wild, powerful. It was imperfect, yet vast, alive, full of possibility.

Andy’s eyes filled with tears. He realized then how those barren abstractions inside the cave had stripped reality of all its richness, complexity, and vitality. He had to go back. He had to tell the others.

He returned the way he came, carrying the smell of earth and sunlight back into the Cave Projector Room.

“My friends! We’ve been deceived!” He pointed at the flawless image of the “Ideal River” on the wall, his voice shaking. “The real river outside—it’s murky, it churns, it carries silt and life! That is the truth!”

A brief silence, then uproar.

The Overseer—a man in a spotless white robe, face stern—appeared swiftly on the high platform. He pointed at Andy, his voice booming with condemnation.

“Behold! The Escaped One! His mind has been poisoned by the ‘illusions’ outside! He speaks madness now, trying to taint our pure ‘World of Forms’ with those low, crude, defective ‘false appearances’!”

The residents stared at Andy with suspicion, fear, even disgust.

“He says the river is murky? Absurd! Murkiness is impurity, is decay—how can that be real?”
“Look at him—covered in filth. He has fallen into evil.”
“The Overseer is right. Only the shadows on this wall are the eternal, unchanging truth!”

Andy fought to explain—the warmth of the sun, the touch of the wind, the river’s roar. But the more he described, the more the others recoiled. They couldn’t grasp these sensory, tangible, flowing experiences. To them, it was the raving of a madman.

Finally, to the Overseer’s cry of “Cleanse the mind! Expel the heresy!”, Andy was forced back into his seat. The chains were refastened, tighter now. He was placed in the front row, made to gaze day and night at the “Perfect Circle” and “Absolute Good,” to “purify” his “corrupted” perception.

On the wall, the images remained perfect, steady, lifeless.

Andy looked at that abstracted, purified “Heaven of Forms,” then remembered the muddy, roaring, teeming world outside. A bitter, ironic smile touched his lips.

He understood now. Some people choose to remain prisoners in this gilded cage of “perfect forms.” And they will always see anyone who tries to show them the key as their greatest enemy.
