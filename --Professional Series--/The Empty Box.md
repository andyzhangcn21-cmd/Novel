**The Empty Box**

It was Andy’s first day of moving, and all he brought with him was a small pinewood box, no bigger than the palm of his hand.

Inside the box were three things: a dull, worn charcoal pencil, a small piece of dry bread to erase mistakes, and a tightly rolled canvas. The canvas was wound so tightly it looked like a pale seed waiting for spring. His new home was just across the street, but he decided to take a detour around the city for a more deliberate migration. The moving cart floated effortlessly down the streets, light as a feather, drifting like a leaf on water.

On the seventh day, he added a lamp. A brass stand, a glass shade, and the light fell precisely on one corner of the canvas, like a stage spotlight. Under the lamp, he saw the roughness of the charcoal pencil, the humble nature of the bread crumbs. So he added more to his cart—a finely carved walnut pencil case and soft bark, arranged on a crystal dish, specifically for erasing.

On the thirtieth day, he thought the light was too lonely. He brought in a “Wanderer” series sofa, said to have curves that guided the mind to unknown realms. He also brought in a “Silent Voice” carpet, woven with golden fibers designed to absorb noise. They worked. The sofa made him drowsy, the carpet hushed the room into complete silence, and he no longer heard the scratching of the pencil. The engine of the moving cart gave off a low, muffled hum.

On the one-hundredth day, he purchased an “Mountain Morning” air purifier, whose vents emitted the expensive scent of pine and frost, designed to counteract the real winds of the city. He installed a “Collector’s Dream” wine cabinet, filled with empty bottles symbolizing vast knowledge. He customized an “Immortal” desk, made from an indestructible composite material, with a large book sitting on top, a book he would never open.

His migration had become a moving feast. People no longer cared about what he painted. Instead, they admired the taste of the objects he moved. His cart grew larger, from a van to a heavy-duty truck, and finally to a self-contained modular transport platform requiring special permits. The platform was stacked high, a bizarre array of objects piled on top of each other, forming a precarious yet dazzling structure.

On the last day, he stood at the top of the platform, directing the hoisting of his final and greatest creation—*The Shine Without Source*. A massive, intricately constructed metal device, its sole purpose was to simulate the first spark of light from the birth of the universe once powered up. Critics called it “The Ultimate Inquiry Into Existence.”

When the device was hoisted, the entire city groaned. When it was finally placed atop this “Mountain of Possessions,” the balance shifted. It wasn’t the explosive crash one might expect, but a long, piercing screech of metal twisting. One of the platform’s load-bearing shafts bent slowly, then cracked under the excessive pressure.

The platform tilted. *The Shine Without Source* tumbled, crashing into the middle of the street, no light—just a pile of expensive scrap metal. Immediately, like a row of falling dominoes, the entire “mountain” began to slide. The bottles from the “Collector’s Dream” cabinet shattered, the “Silent Voice” carpet was torn to shreds, and the stuffing from the “Wanderer” sofa drifted like snowflakes.

All of it blocked the city’s largest intersection, not in the dramatic fashion of a disaster film, but in the grand, silent manner of a landfill. The arteries of traffic were completely clogged by these lavish, lifeless things.

People were trapped in their cars, angrily honking their horns. Andy stood at the edge of the wreckage, staring around in confusion. He wanted to paint this absurd scene, to capture the collapse brought on by accumulation.

Instinctively, he reached for the charcoal pencil inside the pinewood box. But instead, he pulled out the latest model of a smart drawing pen, its screen cracked, unable to turn on.

He futilely swiped it through the air, leaving no mark. Only the exhaust fumes from the blocked vehicles streaked across the sky, painting an abstract gray canvas no one would ever appreciate.
